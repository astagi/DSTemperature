DSTemperature
=============

Yet another Dallas Temperature Control Library for Arduino, tiny, light and simple to use, really useful if you just want to read the temperature from your 18X20 Dallas sensors. For an advanced use of these devices look for DallasTemperature library.

Requirements
------------

- OneWire: library to control devices (from Dallas Semiconductor) that use the One Wire protocol. (http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/OneWire)

How to use it with the IDE
--------------------------

1. Before start using Dallas temperature devices, take a look at the relative data sheet (for example DS18S20 http://datasheets.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/DS18S20.pdf)

2. Copy the folder DSTemperature in sketchbook/libraries.

3. Include DSTemperature and OneWire in your code using Sketch -> Import Library -> NAME_OF_THE_LIBRARY.

4. Open DSTemperature/examples/ReadAll.ino sketch to start!
